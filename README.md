# EbankingApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.9.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```
If you don't have an e2e target configured, you can use Cypress directly:

- Start the dev server: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:4200)
- In another terminal run the Cypress test suite (headless): `npm run e2e:run`
- Or open interactive test runner: `npm run e2e:open`

The repository includes a smoke test at `cypress/e2e/payments.cy.ts` which:
- Initiates a payment via the UI
- Verifies it appears in the payments list
- Verifies pagination (page size and Next button)

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
